# Create HMM with Pommegrenate


# Create A single Array from the HMM
equation_inputs = [4,-2,3.5]

# Step 0: Create a Parent HMM
# Generate a bunch of Sequences from the HMM
# Split the sequences into training and testing
# number of training sequences: generations*







# Step 1b: Create HMM Vector Representation
# args - number of states, - number of emmission symbols

# Step 2: Transform that motherfucker into a DNA vector



# Step 1a: Create HMM

    




    # create hmm from vector
# get some observation-sequences from the training set
# take the average of the acceptance of the solutions
